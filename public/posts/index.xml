      <description>Introduction Deep convolutional neural networks have been around for a while and have completely revolutionized how we tackle image recognition task in computer vision. When AlexNet came out in 2012 it revolutionized how we use CNN&amp;rsquo;s as it was the first time we saw an architecture with consecutive Convolutional Layers with significant improvement in training speed and performance. This was achieved by leveraging deeper architecture and GPU accelaration.This 8 layer deep CNN was one of first to have this kind of performance for a largescale image classification.</description>
