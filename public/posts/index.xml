      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep convolutional neural networks have been around for a while and have completely revolutionized how we tackle image recognition task in computer vision.
When &lt;em&gt;AlexNet&lt;/em&gt; came out in 2012 it revolutionized how we use CNN&amp;rsquo;s as it was the first time we saw an
architecture with consecutive Convolutional Layers with significant improvement in training speed and performance which it did by leveraging deeper architecture and GPU accelaration.This &lt;strong&gt;8 layer deep CNN&lt;/strong&gt; was one of first to have this kind of performance for a largescale image classification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
